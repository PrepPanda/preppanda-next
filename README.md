## Experience the future of exams.

The project is about creating an online tool for teachers to make and share question papers, manage student groups, set deadlines, and analyse student performance. Teachers can track how much time students spend on each question and get detailed insights into student and group performance through simple statistical analysis.  It includes features like face detection to prevent cheating during exams. This platform aims to make exam management easier for teachers and create a fair and secure environment for students during assessments.
